    "The purpose of this notebook is to implement the ideas that I had learned throughout the Short Course in Causal Inference taught by Lok, Hernán, Robins, VanderWeele, and Tchetgen-Tchetgen. This will focus on models that estimate the average causal effect (ACE) that have general applicability (i.e. unbiased in time-fixed _and_ time-varying scenarios, assuming certain assumptions are met). Matching, outcome regression, etc., are known to produce biased estimates of ACE in the latter scenario. Instead, we'll be looking at g-formula, mean structural models, structural nested mean models, which have broader applicability. \n",

Since this is an intervention, the node $X=1$ (in blue) doesn't have any arrows leading to it. Intervening on the population to give them the same treatment $X=1$ then gives us the counterfactual outcome $Y^{X=1}$. From the SWIG, we can see a path from $X$ to $Y^{X=1}$: $X \\leftarrow Z \\rightarrow Y^{X=1}$. By $d$-separation, we know that conditioning on $Z$ blocks the flow of information between $X$ and $Y^{X=1}$. Thus, we know that $Y^{X=1} \\mathrel{\\unicode{x2AEB}} X \\mid Z$. This is called conditional exchangeability. In other words, having conditioned on $Z$, the observed treatment group $X$ is independent of what we're trying to estimate, $Y^{X=1}$. The treated ($X=1$) and the untreated ($X=0$) are exchangeable / comparable after conditioning on confounder $Z$, as severity $Z$ would then be evenly distributed between the two treatment groups. Because of this even distribution of severity of disease in the two groups, the average treatment effect on either groups should be the same.
